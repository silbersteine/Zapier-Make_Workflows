## Centralize Comments Made Across Your Lokalise Projects in a Google Sheet  

### Workflow Explanation  

Effortlessly track and manage comments from across your Lokalise projects with this workflow. Anytime a comment is made on a Lokalise project where the webhook is configured, the comment is added to a Google Sheet. This workflow also allows you to transform the date/time formatting from Lokalise's default settings to match your preferred timezone and format. By centralizing comments in one place, you can ensure better collaboration and stay organized across multiple projects.
