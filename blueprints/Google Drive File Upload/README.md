## Upload new files in your GDrive folder to Lokalise 

### Workflow Explanation  

Whenever a new file is created in your Google Drive folder, this workflow adds file-sharing preferences, converts the file URL to Base64 encoding using a free Base64 Encoder/Decoder, and uploads the file to Lokalise. The Base64 Encoder is a free app on the Zapier platform but requires signup. This workflow supports all of Lokalise's doct-type supported file formats DOCX, PPTX, HTML,IDML, and Google Docs and Google Slides.
