## Upload Your Jira Issue's Attachments to Lokalise  

### Workflow Explanation  

Simplify your workflow by automatically uploading Jira issue attachments to your Lokalise project. When a new Jira issue is created, this workflow identifies all attachments associated with the issue and seamlessly uploads them to your Lokalise project. This ensures that all relevant files are centralized and accessible within Lokalise, eliminating the need for manual uploads and streamlining your localization process.
